In October 2001, Windows XP, produced by Microsoft, brought about the next step in the development of operating systems for personal computers. A combination of the stability of Windows NT and the friendly graphical user interface of Windows 98 made it possible to get along both inexperienced and professional users. XP, with its Lunaâ€™s image, which was very unusual, included a desktop interface that was more stylized and accepted, which was easier to use and more compeling. Of note is that, the availability of fast user switching was extremely convenient as it did not require any user to log off when another person needed to use that computer. Even the performance of the operating system was improved and, various features like the Windows Firewall were enhanced that, ensure the privacy and security of your computer system were provided. Furthermore, System Restore came in handy as it helped the user to revert to a previous date in case any update was unacceptable or some software installation went wrong.

Even though the official support Four years XP was still in use up to 2014 in various narrow specialization areas, underlining its place in the history of information technology and culture.
